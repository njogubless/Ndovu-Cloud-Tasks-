# 1. About my Sample Project
My sample project is baiscally a Report_System where departments in an Organization will have a more efficient way of providing reports for the work they have achived.

As most tech comapnies have standups to have a review of work done and challenges experienced by various developers, this particular sample project was aimed to provide space for a more detailed explanation of what departments have been able to cover. 

# What has been covered. 

By the use of the Travis CI I have runned a couple of unit test on the models I had and through the test.py file I was able to debug some code and add partcular instances in my test.py.

All the 6 tests for the models I had runned successfuly using the 
'''
python language

 python manage.py test" command 
 '''
